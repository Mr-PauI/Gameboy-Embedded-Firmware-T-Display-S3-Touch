Precompiled binaries of Gameboy Embedded Firmware with version numbers attached. Requires m5launcher and use the the merge tool to play a game.

Attention: For now, with the early BLE gamepad implementation; download .bins with the suffix _BLEautoconnect will connect to the
first available ble gamepad in pairing mode(ie: xbox one 1708 with latest firmware). Otherwise, for on-screen only interface use the .bins without the suffix.
