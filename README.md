# Gameboy-Embedded-Firmware-T-Display-S3-Touch
This is a lite version of the gameboy enhanced firmware that does not require an SD card be present; but instead allows you to 'insert' your games into the firmwares .bin file, to create your own personal .bin files for each game. Gamepad support is fully implemented in this version.
